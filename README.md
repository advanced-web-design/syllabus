## Course overview

The Advanced Web Design course is designed to prepare students for professional web design work. The class will be a mix of theoretical/soft skills and practical front-end techniques. We will cover usability, accessibility, design professionalism, git/github.com, JavaScript, jQuery, designing and developing from static comps, and designing for a content management system. By the end of this course, students should have a solid understanding of the web design industry and modern web design techniques.  

## Assignments

All assignments will be described at the assignments repo, <https://github.com/advanced-web-design/assignments>.

Assignments are expected to be completed **before** the beginning of the class on the given due date.

## Attendance expectations

Class attendance is essential to your success in this course. The topics discussed in class will build upon one another and working during class time allows us to collaborate. **If you are going to miss a class, email me prior to the start of class.**

After 3 missed classes, each missed class (including the original 3) will result in a **5% deduction** from the class participation grade.

## Grading
